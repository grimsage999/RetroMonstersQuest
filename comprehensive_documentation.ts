/**
 * COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION FOR COSMIC PLAYGROUND SYSTEMS
 * 
 * This document provides detailed explanations of the game's complex systems
 * to aid future contributors and maintainers.
 */

/**
 * GAME ENGINE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
 * ================================
 * 
 * The game follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
 * 
 * 1. Game Engine (main orchestrator)
 * 2. Game Systems (specialized modules)
 * 3. Game Entities (player, enemies, hazards)
 * 4. Game State Management
 * 
 * The refactored engine follows the Single Responsibility Principle:
 * - GameEngine: Orchestrates the game loop and manages the high-level flow
 * - InputSystem: Handles all input processing and state management
 * - CollisionSystem: Manages collision detection and spatial partitioning
 * - StateManager: Manages game state changes and transitions
 * - GameRenderer: Handles all visual rendering operations
 * - AudioManager: Manages all audio playback and resources
 * 
 * DATA FLOW:
 * Input -> InputSystem -> GameEngine -> Entity Updates -> CollisionSystem -> State Updates -> Rendering
 */

/**
 * COLLISION DETECTION SYSTEM
 * ==========================
 * 
 * The collision system uses a two-tier approach for optimal performance:
 * 
 * 1. Broad-Phase Collision (Spatial Partitioning):
 *    - Uses a SpatialGrid to divide the game world into cells
 *    - Reduces collision checks from O(nÂ²) to O(n*k) where k << n
 *    - Each object is placed in one or more grid cells based on its bounds
 *    - Potential collisions are detected by checking objects in overlapping cells
 * 
 * 2. Narrow-Phase Collision (Precise Detection):
 *    - Uses Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) algorithm for exact collision detection
 *    - Formula: Two rectangles collide if:
 *      - rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.width
 *      - rect1.x + rect1.width > rect2.x  
 *      - rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.height
 *      - rect1.y + rect1.height > rect2.y
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Grid cell size should balance between too few cells (many objects per cell) and too many cells (high memory overhead)
 * - Default cell size of 100x100 pixels provides good balance for most scenarios
 * - Objects that span multiple cells are inserted into all relevant cells
 * 
 * COLLISION HIERARCHY:
 * - Player collides with: cookies, enemies, hazards
 * - Projectiles (if implemented) collide with: enemies, environment
 * - Enemies don't typically collide with each other
 */

/**
 * PLAYER MOVEMENT SYSTEM
 * ======================
 * 
 * The player movement system implements smooth movement with acceleration/deceleration:
 * 
 * ACCELERATION MODEL:
 * - When input is applied: velocity changes toward target velocity gradually
 * - When input is released: velocity decreases gradually (deceleration)
 * - Formulas:
 *   - Target velocity = inputDirection * maxSpeed
 *   - New velocity = currentVelocity + (targetVelocity - currentVelocity) * accelerationFactor
 * 
 * DASH MECHANISM:
 * - Special movement mode with increased speed
 * - Provides temporary invincibility during dash
 * - Has cooldown period to prevent spamming
 * - Includes visual effects (trail, animation changes)
 * 
 * ANIMATION STATES:
 * - idle: When player is not moving
 * - walking: When player is moving
 * - dashing: When player is dashing
 * - starting/stopping: Transitional states for smooth animation
 * 
 * SQUASH AND STRETCH:
 * - Visual technique to make movements feel more dynamic
 * - Applied during state transitions (starting, dashing, stopping)
 * - Uses non-uniform scaling to emphasize movement
 */

/**
 * GAME STATE MANAGEMENT
 * ====================
 * 
 * The game state system manages all game phases and transitions:
 * 
 * STATE HIERARCHY:
 * - Main game phases: TITLE -> PLAYING -> GAME_OVER/VICTORY
 * - Level states: LOADING -> PLAYING -> COMPLETE
 * - Special states: CUTSCENE, TRANSITION, PAUSED
 * 
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - TITLE -> PLAYING: When player starts the game
 * - PLAYING -> GAME_OVER: When player loses all lives
 * - PLAYING -> VICTORY: When player completes all levels
 * - PLAYING -> LEVEL_COMPLETE: When player finishes a level
 * - LEVEL_COMPLETE -> PLAYING: When advancing to next level
 * 
 * STATE DATA STRUCTURE:
 * - Score
 * - Lives
 * - Current level
 * - Game phase
 * - Cookies collected
 * - Total cookies in level
 * - Dash availability status
 */

/**
 * LEVEL PROGRESSION SYSTEM
 * ========================
 * 
 * The level system manages progression through the game world:
 * 
 * LEVEL STRUCTURE:
 * - Each level has a unique configuration in LEVEL_CONFIGS
 * - Includes enemy types, counts, and positions
 * - Contains environmental hazards and special features
 * - Defines win conditions (collect all cookies + reach finish line)
 * 
 * PROGRESSION ORDER:
 * - Defined in GAME_CONFIG.LEVEL_SEQUENCE
 * - Currently: [1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]
 * - Each number represents a specific level with different challenges
 * 
 * LEVEL SPECIFIC FEATURES:
 * - Level 1.x: Desert environment with CIA agents
 * - Level 1.5: Dancing cacti hazards
 * - Level 1.75: Spinning cactus with fireballs
 * - Level 2.x: Urban environment with army units
 * - Level 2.5: Manhole hazards
 * - Level 2.75: Alligator mini-boss in manholes
 * - Level 3.x: Underground environment
 * - Level 3.5: Alligator boss fight
 * - Level 4.x: Graveyard with zombies
 * - Level 4.5: Necromancer mini-boss
 * - Level 5: Final laboratory level
 * 
 * DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY:
 * - Enemy count and behavior adjusts based on remaining cookies
 * - Less cookies = more aggressive enemies
 */

/**
 * ENEMY AI BEHAVIOR SYSTEM
 * ========================
 * 
 * Each enemy type has distinct behavior patterns:
 * 
 * CIA AGENTS:
 * - Move in straight lines until hitting boundaries
 * - Bounce off edges of screen
 * - Random initial movement direction
 * 
 * ARMY MEN:
 * - Similar to CIA agents but with different movement patterns
 * - May have slightly different speeds
 * 
 * RADIOACTIVE RATS:
 * - Faster movement than other enemies
 * - More erratic movement patterns
 * - 3-frame animation cycle for dynamic appearance
 * 
 * ZOMBIES:
 * - Slower movement
 * - More predictable patterns
 * - Distinct visual appearance with decay details
 * 
 * SPECIAL ENEMIES (Mini-bosses):
 * - Alligator: Emerges from manholes with different attack patterns
 * - Alligator Boss: Roams freely with neck extension attacks
 * - Necromancer: Summons ghosts and attacks with broom
 * 
 * AI IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - Uses simple state machines for behavior
 * - Movement patterns pre-computed when possible
 * - Collision detection with player triggers damage
 */

/**
 * AUDIO SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
 * =========================
 * 
 * The audio system uses a pooled resource approach for performance:
 * 
 * AUDIO POOLING:
 * - Pre-loads frequently used sounds
 * - Reuses audio instances to avoid allocation/deallocation overhead
 * - Manages concurrent playback limits
 * 
 * SOUND CATEGORIES:
 * - SFX: Hit sounds, success sounds, cookie collection
 * - Music: Background tracks
 * - Voice: Special dialog or instructions
 * 
 * DYNAMIC AUDIO:
 * - Volume adjustments based on game state
 * - Special effects during specific events (level completion, etc.)
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Limits on simultaneous sounds to prevent audio overload
 * - Fallback mechanisms when audio fails to load
 * - Volume normalization to prevent jarring transitions
 */

/**
 * RENDERING OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
 * =============================
 * 
 * The rendering system uses several optimization techniques:
 * 
 * SPRITE CACHING:
 * - Pre-renders sprites to off-screen canvases
 * - Reuses rendered sprites instead of drawing pixel-by-pixel each frame
 * - Significantly reduces rendering overhead for repeated elements
 * 
 * CONDITIONAL RENDERING:
 * - Skips rendering during non-visible states (game over, cutscenes)
 * - Only renders active game elements
 * - Layered rendering for proper z-ordering
 * 
 * VISUAL EFFECTS:
 * - Dash trails using multiple semi-transparent copies
 * - Screen flashes for feedback
 * - Invincibility blinking
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
 * - Tracks frames per second
 * - Monitors rendering time
 * - Provides diagnostic feedback for optimization
 */

/**
 * INPUT HANDLING SYSTEM
 * =====================
 * 
 * The input system manages all player interaction:
 * 
 * INPUT TYPES:
 * - Keyboard (arrow keys for movement, shift for dash)
 * - Mobile touch controls (on-screen buttons)
 * - Command-based input system for advanced features
 * 
 * INPUT PROCESSING:
 * - Maintains state of all active keys
 * - Prevents input buffering that can cause unwanted actions
 * - Handles input filtering based on game state
 * 
 * DUAL INPUT SUPPORT:
 * - Keyboard and touch controls can coexist
 * - Mobile controls send the same internal commands as keyboard
 * - Consistent behavior regardless of input method
 */

/**
 * MINI-BOSS MECHANICS
 * ===================
 * 
 * Each mini-boss has unique mechanics requiring different strategies:
 * 
 * ALLIGATOR (Level 2.75):
 * - Hides in manholes and emerges to attack
 * - Warning phase with visual indicators
 * - Emerging/attacking/retreating sequence
 * - Different attack types (bite, grab)
 * 
 * ALLIGATOR BOSS (Level 3.5):
 * - Free-roaming with longer-range attacks
 * - Neck extension toward player position
 * - More aggressive when fewer cookies remain
 * 
 * NECROMANCER (Level 4.5):
 * - Stationary position with summoned ghosts
 * - Broom melee attacks when player gets close
 * - Ghosts chase player for limited time
 * 
 * BOSS STATE MACHINES:
 * - Each boss has its own state machine with phases
 * - States: IDLE -> WARNING -> ACTIVE -> RETREAT/COOLDOWN
 * - Behavior adjusts based on player proximity and remaining cookies
 * - Visual and audio feedback for each state
 */
