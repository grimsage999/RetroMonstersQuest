**File Location:** `dist/game_build.zip`  
**File Size:** 1.4 MB  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for web deployment (Newgrounds, Itch.io, or any web host)

## 📁 ZIP Structure

Your deployment ZIP contains all files at the **root level** as required:

```
game_build.zip/
├── index.html              (entry point - at root ✓)
├── assets/
│   ├── index-CKvu-1OS.js   (bundled JavaScript)
│   └── index-CUTkjuiv.css  (bundled styles)
├── sounds/
│   ├── background.mp3
│   ├── hit.mp3
│   └── success.mp3
├── textures/
│   ├── asphalt.png
│   ├── grass.png
│   ├── sand.jpg
│   ├── sky.png
│   └── wood.jpg
├── fonts/
│   └── inter.json
└── geometries/
    └── heart.gltf
```

✅ **index.html is at the ZIP root** (not nested in folders)  
✅ **All assets use relative paths** (will work anywhere)  
✅ **No server-side code required** (pure static files)

2. Create `dist/game_build.zip` with all files at root

### Manual Steps (if needed)
```bash
npm run build          # Build production files
node create_zip.cjs    # Create ZIP file
```

## 🌐 Where to Deploy

### Newgrounds
1. Go to your game upload page
2. Upload `dist/game_build.zip`
3. Extract to root (index.html should be at top level)
4. Set dimensions: 1920x1080 or responsive
5. Enable HTML5 WebGL

### Itch.io
1. Create new project
2. Upload `dist/game_build.zip`
3. Check "This file will be played in the browser"
4. Viewport: 1920x1080 (or fullscreen)

### Self-Hosting
1. Extract `dist/game_build.zip` to your web server
2. Ensure index.html is at the root directory
3. No special server configuration needed
4. Works on any static file host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## ✅ What's Included

### Core Files
- ✅ HTML entry point
- ✅ Bundled JavaScript (309 KB, 85 KB gzipped)
- ✅ Bundled CSS (59 KB, 10 KB gzipped)

### Assets
- ✅ 3 Audio files (background music, hit sound, success sound)
- ✅ 5 Texture files (asphalt, grass, sand, sky, wood)
- ✅ 1 3D Model (heart.gltf)
- ✅ 1 Font file (Inter font data)

### Smart Audio System
Your game uses only 3 audio files but creates many sound effects by adjusting playback rate:
- Dash sound = success.mp3 at 2.0x speed
- Crunch sound = hit.mp3 at 1.5x speed
- Ray gun = hit.mp3 at 0.8x speed
- Adjudicator = success.mp3 at 0.7x speed
- Victory = success.mp3 at 1.2x speed

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Optional Improvements)

### Missing Level Backgrounds (Game Works Without These)
The following textures are referenced but not required:
- `/textures/city_bg.png` (Level 2)
- `/textures/subway_bg.png` (Level 3)
- `/textures/graveyard_bg.png` (Level 4)
- `/textures/lab_bg.png` (Level 5)

**Impact:** Levels will use default backgrounds instead of themed ones  
**Game Will:** Still run perfectly, no crashes

### Missing Metadata (Not Required)
- No favicon.ico (browsers will use default icon)
- No manifest.json (won't be installable as PWA)
