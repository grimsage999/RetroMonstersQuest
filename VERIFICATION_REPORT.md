## 3. Remaining Bugs and Concerns

### üî¥ Critical (Non-Blocking)

1. **Overlapping Transitions**
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Location:** `DiagnosticSystem.ts` lines 224-232
   - **Issue:** UI and level transitions can overlap, causing unpredictable behavior
   - **Impact:** Could cause visual glitches or state corruption
   - **Recommendation:** Add mutex/semaphore to prevent simultaneous transitions

2. **Invalid State Transitions**
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Location:** `DiagnosticSystem.ts` lines 250-258
   - **Issue:** Game might transition GAME_OVER ‚Üí PLAYING directly
   - **Impact:** Bypasses necessary intermediate states
   - **Recommendation:** Enforce state machine validation

3. **Input Queue Leakage**
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Location:** `CommandInputSystem.ts` lines 234-258
   - **Issue:** Growing input queue not properly filtered/processed
   - **Impact:** Delayed or incorrect input handling
   - **Recommendation:** Add queue size limits and cleanup

4. **Potential Memory Leaks**
   - **Severity:** Low-Medium
   - **Location:** `UIStateController.ts`, `GameEngine.ts` lines 880-886
   - **Issue:** Timeouts might not be cleaned up if game stops unexpectedly
   - **Impact:** Memory accumulation over extended play sessions
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure all timeouts tracked in `activeTimeouts` Set

5. **Rendering Errors**
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Location:** `FrameBufferManager.ts` lines 191-197
   - **Issue:** Frames stuck in non-idle state
   - **Impact:** Visual stuttering
   - **Recommendation:** Add timeout recovery mechanism

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Quality Issues

**Dead Code from Removed Features:**
- Weapon system (raygun, adjudicator) - fully commented out
- Boss state machine - set to `null` throughout
- Bullet rendering and update logic - removed
- `Enemy.getRatWalkFrame3()` - defined but never called
- `DamageSystem.getInvincibilityProgress()` - unused method
- `CosmicTextRenderer.renderStarField()` - unused method

**Unused Variables/Configuration:**
- `GameEngine.wasDashing` - minimal usage beyond audio
- `DamageSystem.lastDamageEvent` - assigned but not used
- `GAME_CONFIG.AUDIO.POOL_SIZES` - defined but not used in initialization
- `CommandInputSystem.keyToCommandMap` - includes unused secondary weapon mapping

---

## 4. Console Log Analysis

### Debug Statements Present (59 instances)
Most are **legitimate** for debugging and error handling:
- ‚úÖ Error logging: `console.error()` for critical failures
- ‚úÖ Warning logging: `console.warn()` for issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Info logging: `console.log()` for state transitions and events

**Recommended Actions:**
- Keep error/warning logs for production debugging
- Consider removing verbose info logs for performance
- Add environment check: `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')`

---

## 5. Performance Metrics

### ‚úÖ Optimization Systems Active
- **Spatial Grid:** 100px cells for efficient collision detection
- **Sprite Batching:** Batch rendering for performance
- **Delta Time:** Smooth animations across frame rates
- **Frame Buffer Manager:** Error recovery and performance monitoring

### Browser Performance
- ‚úÖ **No console errors** during gameplay
- ‚úÖ **Smooth frame rate** reported
- ‚úÖ **Hot module replacement** working correctly
- ‚úÖ **No memory leaks** detected in short sessions

### Potential Optimizations
1. Remove debug console.log statements for production
2. Clean up dead code (weapon systems, boss state machine)
3. Optimize texture loading (already using /textures/* correctly)
