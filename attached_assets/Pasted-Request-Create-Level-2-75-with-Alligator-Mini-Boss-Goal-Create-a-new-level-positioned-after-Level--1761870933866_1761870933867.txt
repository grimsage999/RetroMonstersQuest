Request: Create Level 2.75 with Alligator Mini-Boss
Goal: Create a new level positioned after Level 2.2 and before Level 3, duplicating 2.2's layout while adding a menacing alligator mini-boss with dynamic hunting mechanics.
Level Placement

Position: After Level 2.2, before Level 3
Level name: 2.75
Base design: Exact copy of Level 2.2 layout, obstacles, and cookie placements
New element: Alligator mini-boss with psychological horror elements


Alligator Mini-Boss Specifications
Appearance:

Humanoid alligator character wearing a stained/dirty tank top
Only visible from waist up (never fully emerges from manholes)
Pixel art style matching game aesthetic

Introduction Sequence (First Appearance):

Special idle animation when level starts
Plays sinister laughter sound effect
Brief dramatic pause (2-3 seconds) to establish threat before gameplay begins


Audio Design System
Ambient Laughs (Tension Building):

Occur every 10–20 seconds (variable timing)
Sometimes skip a cycle to prevent predictability
NOT tied to attacks—keeps constant psychological pressure
Purpose: Maintain tension even when no attack is imminent

Attack Laughs (Warning Telegraph):

Always precede a direct attack
Play 1–2 seconds before the actual strike
Clear audio signal that danger is immediate
Combined with visual cue for maximum clarity


Attack Pattern System
Attack Types:

Alternates between biting and grabbing attacks
Pattern logic: Mostly random with occasional "runs" (e.g., bite-bite-grab-bite)
Randomness prevents pattern memorization while allowing organic variety
Maintains unpredictability for psychological tension

Spawn Point Behavior:

ALL manholes in the level are potential spawn locations
Never fully emerges—strikes quickly and immediately retreats
Randomized spawn selection each attack


Visual Telegraph System
Pre-Attack Warning (Every Attack):

Manhole shakes/rattles immediately before emergence
Add glowing effect OR smoke/slime splatter around manhole edges
Visual cue appears simultaneously with attack laugh (1–2 seconds before strike)
Combined audio + visual warning ensures fair gameplay


Dynamic Difficulty Scaling (Cookie-Based)
Attack Frequency Based on Cookie Count:

Max cookies collected:

Slowest pace: 8–10 second cooldown between attacks
Easier to navigate and collect remaining cookies


Mid-game (moderate cookies):

Medium pace: 6–8 second cooldown
Balanced pressure


Low/no cookies remaining:

Fastest pace: 5–7 second cooldown
Maximum pressure—punishes cookie loss



Speed scaling creates risk/reward: Losing cookies makes the boss more aggressive, adding urgency to protect your score.

Combat Mechanics

Damage: ONE-HIT KILL—instant level failure if caught by bite or grab
Invincibility: Boss cannot be defeated—must be avoided entirely
Movement: Travels underground between manholes
Strike speed: Fast emergence and retreat—no time spent fully exposed


Technical Implementation Requirements
Level Structure:

Duplicate all Level 2.2 code/assets
Position as Level 2.75 in progression system
Mark all manhole sprites as spawn points

Animation States:

Introduction idle + sinister laugh
Pre-attack warning (laugh + emerge animation)
Bite attack animation
Grab attack animation
Retreat animation (back into manhole)
Ambient laugh (periodic, no attack)

Audio Integration:

Sinister laugh (introduction only)
Maniacal laugh (attack warning, 1–2 sec before strike)
Ambient laughs (every 10–20 seconds, variable)
Randomized timing to prevent predictability

Visual Effects:

Manhole shake/rattle animation
Glow effect OR smoke/slime splatter around active manhole
Clear visual telegraph synchronized with audio cue

Gameplay Systems:

Collision detection for instant-kill attacks
Cookie count tracking for speed scaling
Attack cooldown timer (5–10 seconds based on cookies)
Randomized attack type selection (bite vs. grab)
Randomized spawn point selection
Audio timing system (ambient vs. attack laughs)


Expected Outcome

Level 2.75 positioned correctly in progression (after 2.2, before 3)
Maintains Level 2.2's structure with added tension mechanic
Alligator creates constant psychological pressure through ambient audio
One-hit-kill mechanic significantly raises stakes
Dynamic difficulty punishes cookie loss with increased aggression
Fair but challenging gameplay through clear audio/visual warnings
Unpredictable attack patterns prevent memorization
Smooth, menacing animations that never show full character model


Playtesting Notes
Tuning priorities:

Cooldown timing should feel urgent but fair (test 5–10 second range)
Ambient laugh frequency shouldn't become annoying (adjust if needed)
Attack telegraph (1–2 seconds) should give enough reaction time
Visual effects should be obvious without cluttering screen

Please confirm implementation approach and let me know if you need sprite references for the alligator character or manhole visual effects.
