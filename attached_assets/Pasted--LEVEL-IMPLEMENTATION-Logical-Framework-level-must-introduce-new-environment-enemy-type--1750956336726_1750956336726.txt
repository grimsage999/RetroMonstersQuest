LEVEL 5: Government Lab + Boss Cathedral
Phase 1 Logic:

If player_interacts(lab_objects) ‚Üí reveal(lore_fragments)
If player_finds(adjudicator_bag) ‚Üí unlock(ultimate_weapon)
Phase 1 Implementation:
* Environment: Sterile lab, blinking lights, beakers, desks
* Interactables (using Shift key):
    * Tables, skeleton models, lab tools ‚Üí display "???"
    * Bag on desk ‚Üí "Look inside" ‚Üí "You've obtained The Adjudicator"
* The Adjudicator Mechanics:
    * Glowing orb floats above Cosmo
    * Press X: shoots tracking light orbs
    * Instant kill (overrides Ray Gun's 3-hit rule)
    * 5-second cooldown + glowing aura + sound pulse FX
* Transition: Door interaction ‚Üí "Enter the Training Room?" ‚Üí Yes proceeds
Boss Logic:

Boss_phases = [
  {hits: 20, behavior: "pause_to_breathe"},
  {hits: 50, behavior: "turn_red + speed_increase"},
  {hits: 80, behavior: "turn_blue + ball_form"},
  {hits: 100, behavior: "explode_into_cookies"}
]
Phase 2 Implementation:
* Environment: Gothic cathedral, candlelit pews, stained glass, smoke FX

* Audio: Epic, glitchy drum & bass boss theme
* Ending Sequence:
    * Ambience drops ‚Üí echo of empty hallway
    * White room ‚Üí text: "what?"
    * Final door ‚Üí "Go through?" ‚Üí Fade to black
    * Title card: "Cosmic Playground will be back on Halloween! üéÉ"
    * UFO animation ‚Üí restart prompt
üç™ CORE INTERACTIONS & FEEDBACK LOOPS
Logical Framework:

‚àÄ player_action ‚Üí must_trigger(satisfying_feedback)
Feedback_quality = f(visual_fx, audio_fx, haptic_response)
Implementation Directives:
Title Screen Requirements:
* Starfield parallax background
* UFO gently floating animation
* Cheerful synth melody loop
* Text: "COSMIC PLAYGROUND" + "Press [Space] to Start"

* Enemy-specific movement sounds
Feedback Loop Implementation:
* Cookie Collection: Visual pop + audio crunch + brief screen flash
* Enemy Defeat: Death animation + satisfying audio sting
* Weapon Fire: Screen shake + particle effects + audio impact
* Level Completion: Victory fanfare + transition effect
üéµ AUDIO SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Logical Framework:

Audio_effectiveness = f(environmental_match, emotional_arc, retro_aesthetic)
‚àÄ level ‚Üí unique_musical_theme + ambient_sfx_layer
Implementation Directives:

    * Level 1: Drum & bass with alien tones
    * Level 2: Gritty breakbeat
    * Level 3: Underground electronic ambient
    * Level 4: Spooky but playful drum & bass
    * Level 5: Epic glitchy boss battle theme
* Audio Sources: Pixabay (5,676+ chiptune loops), Kenney Audio (CC0), FreeSound (CC0)
üìù NARRATIVE INTEGRATION
Story Logic:

If cookies = encoded_joy AND CIA_hoards_cookies = control
Then Cosmo_quest = reclaim_joy_through_resistance
Tone Framework: Invader Zim √ó Outer Wilds
* Act I: Escape + collection
* Act II: Discovery + weapons
* Act III: Boss + catharsis
* Epilogue: Mystery + sequel tease
üîß TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Asset Requirements:
* All assets: 100% royalty-free, commercial use approved

* Font: Monogram for all text elements
Performance Targets:
* Smooth 60fps gameplay
* Responsive controls (< 50ms input lag)
* Efficient sprite rendering

üéØ QUALITY ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK
Testing Logic:

‚àÄ implemented_feature ‚Üí must_pass(functionality_test + feel_test + audio_test)
Game_quality = f(technical_stability, gameplay_feel, aesthetic_consistency)
