COSMIC PLAYGROUND - GBA Style Analysis Needed

Game Overview:
- 16x16 pixel art platformer starring Cosmo the Alien
- Core mechanics: stealth, dodging, cookie collection
- 5 levels with escalating difficulty
- Boss battle finale
- Target: Authentic GBA feel with modern polish

Please analyze and provide feedback on:

1. GAMEPLAY FLOW & PACING
   - Does the difficulty curve feel natural?
   - Are the controls responsive enough for GBA-style precision?
   - Is the core loop (collect cookies → avoid enemies → reach exit) engaging?
   - How does the 3-hit Ray Gun vs instant-kill Adjudicator balance feel?

2. GBA AUTHENTICITY
   - Does the 16x16 pixel art maintain GBA visual standards?
   - Are the screen transitions and effects true to GBA limitations?
   - Is the color palette within GBA's 32,768 color range?
   - Do the sound effects match GBA audio quality/style?

3. LEVEL DESIGN QUALITY
   - Level 1 (Desert): Does it teach mechanics effectively?
   - Level 2 (City): Good difficulty progression?
   - Level 3 (Subway): Ray Gun introduction well-paced?
   - Level 4 (Graveyard): Zombie mechanics balanced?
   - Level 5 (Lab/Cathedral): Boss fight satisfying?

4. PLAYER ENGAGEMENT
   - Is the humor landing effectively?
   - Does the stealth feel meaningful or frustrating?
   - Are the enemy patterns predictable but challenging?
   - Is cookie collection rewarding enough?

5. TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE
   - Maintaining 60fps on weaker hardware?
   - Loading times between levels acceptable?
   - Input lag staying under 50ms?
   - Memory usage optimized for browser/mobile?

6. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
   - What feels unpolished or incomplete?
   - Where could the GBA authenticity be stronger?
   - Which mechanics need refinement?
   - What would make this more addictive?

Please play through the game and provide specific, actionable feedback as if you were a senior game developer reviewing this for a GBA-style indie game submission.
