Replit Agent: Cosmic Playground Complete Status Audit
Request Overview
Please provide a comprehensive status report of the current "Cosmic Playground" game implementation. I need to understand exactly where we stand before implementing new visual/aesthetic changes based on my Pinterest mood board analysis.
Required Status Report Sections:
🎮 Core Gameplay Systems
Current Implementation Status:

 Player Movement: Arrow key controls, movement speed, collision detection
 Jump/Dodge Mechanics: Animation states, physics, responsiveness
 Life System: Health tracking, damage detection, game over states
 Cookie Collection: Collection mechanics, counter display, level completion triggers
 Win/Lose Conditions: Exit unlocking, level progression, restart functionality

Performance Check:

Current FPS performance and any lag issues
Input responsiveness (target: <50ms)
Memory usage and optimization status

👽 Character & Animation Systems
Cosmo Implementation:

 Base Sprite: Current design vs. target "little green man" aesthetic
 Animation States: Walk cycle, jump, dodge, idle, death, celebration
 Audio Integration: Footfall SFX, action sounds

Enemy Implementation:

 CIA Agents: Sprites, walk cycles, collision, AI behavior
 Army Men: Current status vs. design doc specifications
 Additional Enemies: Radioactive rats, zombies (if implemented)

🗺️ Level Implementation Status
For each level, report:

 Level 1 (Roswell): Environment art, enemy spawning, audio
 Level 2 (Dystopian City): Implementation percentage, asset integration
 Level 3 (Subway): Ray Gun mechanic status, new enemy integration
 Level 4 (Graveyard): Zombie AI, environmental hazards
 Level 5 (Government Lab + Boss): Phase implementation, boss mechanics

Level Transition System:

Scene loading/unloading functionality
Progress saving between levels
Visual transition effects

🎯 Ready for Enhancement Areas
Identify which systems are stable enough for aesthetic updates:

Which elements can safely receive visual overhauls?
What needs debugging before aesthetic changes?
Which features require completion before Pinterest-inspired modifications?

Output Format

Use checkboxes for clear yes/no status items
Include specific technical details (file names, function names, performance metrics)
Highlight any blockers or critical issues
Provide clear recommendations for next development priorities


Goal: Get a complete picture of current game state so I can intelligently apply Pinterest mood board insights without breaking existing functionality.
