Cosmic Playground: Critical Systems Completion - From 85% to Production Ready
My 2D arcade game "Cosmic Playground" has achieved solid technical foundations with 60 FPS performance, optimized collision systems, and complete core gameplay mechanics. According to my latest diagnostic analysis, I'm at ~85% implementation with three specific blocking issues preventing full production readiness.
Current Technical Status:

Core gameplay loop: 100% functional across 5 themed levels
Performance: Stable 60 FPS with spatial grid optimization (70% collision improvement)
Architecture: Clean TypeScript classes with comprehensive state management
Audio: 85% complete with pooling system preventing memory leaks

Three Critical Blockers Requiring Resolution:
Priority 1: Cutscene Rendering Pipeline
Issue: Intermittent black screens during level initialization cutscenes
Impact: Breaks narrative flow and player immersion
Current Status: GameStateManager and rendering systems operational, but race condition in canvas buffer management during state transitions
Priority 2: Level 5 Boss Fight Completion
Issue: Boss mechanics 60% implemented - missing multi-phase combat integration
Impact: Cannot achieve game completion, blocks final progression milestone
Current Status: Boss state machine architecture exists, needs AI behavior tree completion and weapon system integration
Priority 3: Input Event Isolation During Transitions
Issue: Button inputs bleeding through protected transition states
Impact: Players can interrupt level changes despite UIStateController blocking
Current Status: Event filtering framework operational, needs bulletproof input queue management
Implementation Request:
I need surgical code solutions that integrate with my existing optimized architecture. The diagnostic system shows healthy performance metrics, so fixes must preserve the current 60 FPS target and clean TypeScript structure while resolving these three specific blockers.
Success Criteria:

Cutscene system: 100% reliable state transitions with no rendering failures
Boss encounter: Complete Level 5 victory condition with multi-phase combat
Input management: Absolute event isolation during all protected states
Performance: Maintain current optimization benchmarks

Focus on targeted patches that complete the missing 15% functionality while preserving the working 85% foundation.
