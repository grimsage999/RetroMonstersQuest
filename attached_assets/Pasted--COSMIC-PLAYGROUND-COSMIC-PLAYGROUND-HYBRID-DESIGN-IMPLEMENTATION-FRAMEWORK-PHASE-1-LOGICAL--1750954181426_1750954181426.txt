COSMIC PLAYGROUND — HYBRID
DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION
FRAMEWORK
PHASE 1: LOGICAL SYSTEM DESIGN
Deductive Design Logic
None
Given: A retro 8/16-bit pixel art platformer featuring Cosmo the
Alien
If: humor + stealth + dodging + retro feedback loops = core play
pillars
Then: update art, levels, audio, and narrative accordingly
Output: revised game with emotional arc, tight mechanics, and
satisfying progression
Core System Relationships
mathematica
None
∀ game_element ∈ [character, level, audio, narrative]:
→ must_support(humor, stealth, dodging, retro_aesthetic)
→ must_create(satisfying_feedback_loop)
→ must_maintain(16×16_pixel_consistency)
Progression Logic
sqlSQL
∀ level_n ∈ [1–5]:
→ introduce_one_new(environment + enemy/mechanic)
→ maintain(escalating_challenge + humor)
→ end_with(meaningful_payoff)
Core Game Loop Logic
mathematica
None
If player_collects(all_cookies) → unlock(exit)
If player_hit → lose(life) + play(sad_SFX)
If boss_defeated → trigger(cookie_explosion) + advance(narrative)
Design Constraints
ini
None
Resolution = 16×16_pixel
Style = pixel_art + arcade_aesthetic
Font = Monogram
Assets = CC0/CC-BY_only
UI = minimalist + readable
PHASE 2: DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVES
🕹 GAME DESCRIPTION (FOR START MENU)
Use arrow keys to move Cosmo the Alien • Collect all cookies • Avoid CIA agents and more! •
Reach the finish line!
👽 CHARACTER IMPLEMENTATION
Logical Framework:None
If character_design → must_express(identity + emotion) via
animation
Then: Cosmo + Enemies → require(walk_cycles + death_fx +
audio_feedback)
Implementation Directives:
●
●
●
Update Cosmo to classic "little green man" archetype—bulbous head, large black eyes,
tiny body
Fully animate Cosmo with:
○
Walk cycle with SFX tied to footfalls
○
Jump animation
○
Dodge animation
○
Idle animation
○
Death animation (dramatic flash + pixel scatter)
○
Celebration (cookie dance)
Update Enemy Sprites to match 16×16 aesthetic:
○
CIA: dark suits, shades, briefcases, trench coats + walk cycles
○
Army: helmets, camo gear, stern faces + walk cycles
○
Both: death animations (fall, blink out, pixel dissolve)
Asset Source: Korba's "Alien 2D Sprites" (16×16, CC0) for Cosmo base; Chasersgaming's
"Agent Character" (CC0) for enemies
🗺 LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION

LEVEL 5: Government Lab + Boss Cathedral
Phase 1 Logic:
None
If player_interacts(lab_objects) → reveal(lore_fragments)
If player_finds(adjudicator_bag) → unlock(ultimate_weapon)
Phase 1 Implementation:
●
●
Environment: Sterile lab, blinking lights, beakers, desks
Interactables (using Shift key):
○
Tables, skeleton models, lab tools → display "???"●
●
○
Bag on desk →
"Look inside"
→
"You've obtained The Adjudicator"
The Adjudicator Mechanics:
○
Glowing orb floats above Cosmo
○
Press X: shoots tracking light orbs
○
Instant kill (overrides Ray Gun's 3-hit rule)
○
5-second cooldown + glowing aura + sound pulse FX
Transition: Door interaction →
"Enter the Training Room?"
→ Yes proceeds
Boss Logic:
None
Boss_phases = [
{hits: 20, behavior: "pause_to_breathe"},
{hits: 50, behavior: "turn_red + speed_increase"},
{hits: 80, behavior: "turn_blue + ball_form"},
{hits: 100, behavior: "explode_into_cookies"}
]
Phase 2 Implementation:
●
●
●
