# From Architecture to Gameplay - Learning-Focused Implementation Guide

## Understanding the Infrastructure vs. Gameplay Mindset Shift

Your question reveals a crucial insight: **infrastructure code** and **gameplay code** require fundamentally different design approaches, even though they work together.

### Infrastructure Patterns (What You've Mastered)
- **Stability-focused**: Systems that provide reliable services
- **Abstraction-heavy**: Complex interfaces that hide implementation details
- **Error-resilient**: Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance-optimized**: Efficient resource management

### Gameplay Patterns (What We're Building Now)
- **Iteration-focused**: Rapid tweaking and balancing
- **Behavior-explicit**: Clear, readable game rules
- **Designer-friendly**: Non-programmers can understand and modify
- **Feel-oriented**: Prioritizes player experience over technical elegance

## The Entity-Component-System (ECS) Pattern for Gameplay

Rather than object-oriented hierarchies (good for infrastructure), gameplay benefits from **composition over inheritance**.

### Why ECS Works for Gameplay:
1. **Rapid Iteration**: Change behaviors without touching core entity code
2. **Designer Accessibility**: Components map to game design concepts
3. **Performance**: Data-oriented design enables batch processing
4. **Modularity**: Mix and match behaviors freely

## Learning-Focused Implementation Strategy

We'll implement one complete gameplay loop that demonstrates:
1. **Entity Management**: How game objects are structured
2. **System Architecture**: How game logic is organized
3. **Data Flow**: How information moves through the game
4. **Integration Patterns**: How gameplay connects to your infrastructure

## Pattern 1: Entity Architecture

```typescript
// Infrastructure approach (what you have):
class Player extends BaseEntity {
  private health: number;
  private position: Vector2;
  // Rigid inheritance hierarchy
}

// Gameplay approach (what we're building):
interface Entity {
  id: string;
  components: Map<string, Component>;
}

interface Component {
  type: string;
  data: any;
}

// Composition enables rapid gameplay iteration:
const player = {
  id: 'player',
  components: new Map([
    ['position', { x: 400, y: 300 }],
    ['movement', { speed: 200, acceleration: 800 }],
    ['collision', { radius: 20, layer: 'player' }],
    ['health', { current: 100, max: 100 }],
    ['input', { keys: ['w', 'a', 's', 'd'] }]
  ])
};
```

## Pattern 2: System Architecture

```typescript
// Systems process components, not entities
abstract class System {
  abstract requiredComponents: string[];
  abstract update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number): void;
}

class MovementSystem extends System {
  requiredComponents = ['position', 'movement'];
  
  update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number) {
    // Process all entities with position + movement
    // This enables batch optimization
  }
}
```

## Pattern 3: Gameplay Data Flow

```typescript
// Infrastructure: Event-driven, async, error-handled
// Gameplay: Update loop, synchronous, predictable

function gameLoop(deltaTime: number) {
  // 1. Input collection (from your infrastructure)
  inputSystem.update(entities, deltaTime);
  
  // 2. Game logic (new gameplay layer)
  movementSystem.update(entities, deltaTime);
  collisionSystem.update(entities, deltaTime);
  
  // 3. Rendering (to your infrastructure)
  renderSystem.update(entities, deltaTime);
}
```

This guide will help you understand each pattern as we implement it.
